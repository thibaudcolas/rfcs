## Roadmap for the next release

Support for customizations such as additional columns (and filters), reducing the need for developers to create custom views for pages (see [Custom page listings](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/customization/custom_page_listings.html#custom-page-listings)). See [Support custom columns / filters on main page explorer #11931](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/11931) for more info.

### [Independent security audit](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/111)

Size: XS

Revamp of the existing [Python Package Maintenance Guidelines](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Python-Package-Maintenance-Guidelines), to add more content, reflect the work on [Wagtail Nest](https://github.com/wagtail-nest), and modernize.

### Autosave UX enhancements

Size: S

Follow-up improvements to the [Autosave MVP](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/47) based on user feedback and real-world usage. Tentatively including:

- [Deferred validation for required fields in StreamField](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/13699)
- [UI polish based on feedback from v7.3 release](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/13863)

### Page editor UX

Size: M

A range of UX improvements to the editing experience, with a focus on addressing known pain points / clearing our backlog of UX issues. To be refined, based on:

- [Issues labelled 'UX'](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20state%3Aopen%20label%3AUX)
- [Issues labelled 'Design system'](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc+state%3Aopen+label%3A%22component%3ADesign+system%22)

### Content quality checker enhancements

Size: M

Follow-up to [AI checker concepts](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/118), in particular implementation of generic qualitative checkers.

In scope:

- [SEO search description automated content check #12252](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/12252)
- [Universal content comparison interface #158](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-ai/issues/158)
- [Implement checker error highlights within the preview panel #12187](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/12187)

## Roadmap for the next+1 release

Proposed roadmap items for v7.5\* (August 2026).

### [SEO power tools](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/106)

Size: M

See [Looking for sponsorship: SEO power tools](https://wagtail.org/blog/looking-for-sponsorship-seo-power-tools/). New built-in SEO and content quality assurance features, with opportunities for integration with SEO and analytics tools, as well as generative AI.

### [Choosers UI improvements](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/109)

Size: XL

Iterative improvements towards a new design for choosers, which brings them closer to the "Universal listings" UX rolled out across listing views.

### Customizable base page model

Size: M

Introduce an overridable AbstractPage class to allow base page fields to be customized per-project.

References:

- [Per-project base page models #836](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/836)
- [RFC 53: Swappable Page Model](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/53)
- [Feature request: Swappability of main models #11381](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/11381)

### Starter kit relaunch

Overhaul of the `wagtail start` [support for custom templates](https://wagtail.org/blog/building-a-wagtail-starter-template/) and the [news template](https://github.com/wagtail/news-template) for higher usability and maintainability. Key goals:

- Simpler support for multiple starter kits
- Tooling to guarantee starter kits are always up-to-date with latest releases

## Roadmap for "Future" releases

### [Concurrent editing](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/24)

Rename the existing "Autosave" roadmap item to "Concurrent editing", to reflect that [Autosave MVP](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/47) achieves a lot of our "autosave" goals. It would be confusing to still have an "Autosave" item on the roadmap.

### [Natural language search](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/119)

Move existing item to “Future”. Dependent on completion of [Model search improvements](https://github.com/wagtail/roadmap/issues/116).
